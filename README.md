This is a project to build a multi-page responsive website. This is the first project I have done of this scale.

Given this is a personal project, and I am using it as a learning tool, I am not seeking contributions at this stage, however, if you happen to find your way here and check out my code, I would absolutely love to hear from you, and receive any feedback you might have.

Update 3 December 2020

Having made my webpages responsive and building a contact form, I think I am ready to host a first draft my website on Github pages.

The next step for me is to get the php component of the contact form working, so that people can actually use the contact form to get in touch with me. 

Then, I will be ready to solicit feedback from friends and other developers. 

This is all very exciting; stay tuned.
